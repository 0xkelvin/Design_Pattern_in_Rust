## Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and resuse of existing code

1. Factory Method: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created
  
3. Abstract Factory: Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
4. Builder
5. Prototype
6. Singleton: Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance
