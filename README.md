## Use Case: Database Connection Factory

Suppose you’re developing an application that needs to connect to different types of databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite). You want to encapsulate the logic of creating these connections so that the main application code doesn’t have to worry about the specifics of each database.

Components

	1.	Database Connection Interface: This defines the common operations that all database connections should support.
	2.	Concrete Database Connections: Specific implementations for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
	3.	Connection Factory Interface: This defines a method for creating database connections.
	4.	Concrete Connection Factories: Specific factories for creating instances of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite connections.


Explanation

	1.	DatabaseConnection Trait: This defines the interface for all database connections with methods like connect and execute_query.
	2.	Concrete Products: MySQLConnection, PostgreSQLConnection, and SQLiteConnection implement the DatabaseConnection trait.
	3.	ConnectionFactory Trait: This declares the factory method create_connection which returns an object of type DatabaseConnection.
	4.	Concrete Factories: MySQLConnectionFactory, PostgreSQLConnectionFactory, and SQLiteConnectionFactory implement the ConnectionFactory trait and provide their own implementation of the create_connection method to instantiate their respective database connections.
	5.	Client Code: Demonstrates the use of these factories to create database connections and execute queries.

## Why Use the Factory Method Here?

	•	Encapsulation: The main application code doesn’t need to know about the specifics of creating different database connections.
	•	Flexibility: You can easily add support for new types of databases without changing the client code.
	•	Separation of Concerns: The responsibility of creating database connections is separated from the application logic.
